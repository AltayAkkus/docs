# PaaS

::: info
Shopware PaaS is available at request for Shopware merchants. Please approach the Shopware Sales to get more information on Shopware PaaS
:::

Shopware PaaS is a platform-as-a-service to host, deploy and scale for your individual Shopware project.
It comes with the full flexibility and code ownership of a self-hosted Shopware project, but takes away the complexity of building custom infrastructure, build & testing pipelines or deployment automation.

Get started by installing the PaaS CLI on your local development machine.
